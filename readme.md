> A Shiny app to calculate CBCL subscales.

[Link to cbclR Shiny app here.](https://jrcalabrese.shinyapps.io/cbclR/)

I created this tool because the [Child Behavior Checklist](https://aseba.org/school-age/) is commonly used in developmental research and can be difficult to calculate by hand. CBCL questions not provided.

Feedback and suggestions welcome.
